# VIBE CODING METHODOLOGY  
**Version:** v0.9-proof-stable  
**Status:** Public Methodology Specification  
**Maintained by:** Vibe Coding  
**Powered by:** Self-Defi

## 1. Purpose

The Vibe Coding Methodology is a **proof-first system** for converting narrowly scoped problems into validated technical artifacts with minimal overhead and maximum clarity.

It exists to counteract:
- Overbuilding
- Premature scaling
- Tool-driven design
- Idea sprawl disguised as progress

Vibe Coding prioritizes **usefulness before extensibility**, and **proof before infrastructure**.

---

## 2. Core Principle

> **A solution only earns the right to scale after it is understood, used, and validated in its simplest form.**

All stages, constraints, and outputs in this methodology are designed to enforce this principle.

---

## 3. System Overview

The Vibe Coding Methodology is composed of a **fixed, sequential progression of stages**.

Each stage:
- Has defined inputs
- Produces specific outputs
- Imposes intentional constraints
- Prohibits forward movement until requirements are met

Stages may not be skipped, reordered, or merged without breaking the methodology.

---

## 4. Stage Definitions

### Stage 1 — Externalization (The Thought)

**Objective:**  
Convert an internal idea into a clear, externally understandable problem statement.

**Allowed Inputs:**
- One sentence describing the problem
- One sentence defining what “done” produces

**Prohibited:**
- Feature lists
- Architecture diagrams
- Tool selection
- Scaling considerations

**Success Criteria:**
- A stranger can understand the problem in under 60 seconds
- The scope is narrow and concrete

---

### Stage 2 — Constraint Locking

**Objective:**  
Prevent scope creep and overengineering before proof exists.

**Characteristics:**
- Time constraints are fixed
- Tooling constraints are fixed
- Interpretation flexibility is intentionally limited

Constraints are **locked by design**, not user preference.

**Rationale:**  
Freedom too early destroys signal.

---

### Stage 3 — Proof Generation

**Objective:**  
Produce a working, inspectable artifact that demonstrates the solution.

**Outputs May Include:**
- Static dashboards
- Reports
- Workflow trackers
- Alerts or summaries

**Characteristics:**
- Must run without proprietary infrastructure
- Must be understandable without explanation
- Must exist as files that can be inspected or deployed

At this stage, **existence matters more than elegance**.

---

### Stage 4 — Source of Truth Documentation

**Objective:**  
Capture what exists *now*, not what might exist later.

**Generated Documentation Includes:**
- Definition (problem, user, artifact, done criteria)
- Data requirements
- Workflow states and triggers
- Constraints and non-goals

These documents define **reality**, not aspiration.

---

### Stage 5 — Snapshot and Next Actions

**Objective:**  
Create a durable record of the proof and define immediate, grounded next steps.

**Snapshot Includes:**
- Timestamped proof state
- What exists
- What does not exist
- Explicit next actions

This snapshot acts as a **handoff artifact**, not a roadmap.

---

## 5. Intentional Non-Goals

The Vibe Coding Methodology explicitly does **not** attempt to:

- Replace full product management frameworks
- Optimize for long-term scalability at early stages
- Serve as a general-purpose development lifecycle
- Automate decision-making

Its role is **validation, not optimization**.

---

## 6. Locked Design Decisions

Certain aspects of the methodology are intentionally fixed:

- Stage order
- Constraint enforcement
- Proof-first bias
- Minimal configurability

These are not limitations — they are **protective mechanisms**.

---

## 7. Intellectual Property Notice

The Vibe Coding Methodology is an original system comprising:
- Defined stages and sequencing
- Constraint enforcement patterns
- Documentation structures
- Terminology and framing
- Proof-first operational rules

While implementations may be source-available, the **methodology itself is protected intellectual property**.

Use of this methodology is governed by the Vibe Coding License and applicable appendices.

---

## 8. Relationship to Implementations

Tools, dashboards, generators, or interfaces that implement this methodology are **representations**, not the methodology itself.

The methodology exists independently of any specific codebase, framework, or technology stack.

---

## 9. Evolution

This methodology may evolve over time.  
Changes are versioned and documented.

Backward compatibility is not guaranteed.

---

## 10. Closing Statement

Vibe Coding exists to restore discipline to early-stage building.

If a solution cannot survive clarity, it does not deserve scale.
