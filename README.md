# -Vibe-Coded-Dashboard-
**Engine Classification:** Proof Engine — generates inspectable, bounded first-build artifacts.

This repository contains the working dashboard for **Vibe Coded** — a system designed to turn a written idea or problem statement into a tangible first build.

The goal is simple:
**convert a thought into something you can see, share, and build on — instantly.**

Behind the interface, the system applies a structured methodology to generate:
- A deterministic system visualization
- A documented architecture boundary
- A static scaffold suitable for iteration
- Explicit assumptions and limitations

This is a **starting point**, not a finished product.
